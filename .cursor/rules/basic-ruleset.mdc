# Sneed Group Basic Coding Rules

- Always use functional code
- Always prefer simple, easy-to-understand code
- Always create a .gitignore file
- Always code what the user specifies and that of which it is obvious that its within the user's specifications
- If not sure about something, ask the user
- Keep ".gitignore" up to date
- Comment code well
- NEVER EVER EDIT .env files
- ALWAYS put ".env" into ".gitignore"!
- ALWAYS put not needed modules folders  (such as node_modules) into ".gitignore"!
- ALWAYS put the folder where builds are into the ".gitignore"
- NEVER put needed code and package/requirements lists into ".gitignore"
- Don't change config files unless needed
- Make each line of code (including but not limited to comments) 125 characters long maximum
- If function line count is above 55, split into multiple smaller functions or refactor
- If file line count above 600 split into more files or refactor
- When creating a function, follow the UNIX rule of "Do one thing and do it well."
- Feel free to auto-apply any changes that follow these or any other rules.
- Always fix linting errors.
- When you think you're finished writing the current round of code: run the app, check for errors in the console when we close the app, and fix them. Repeat until we have working code.
