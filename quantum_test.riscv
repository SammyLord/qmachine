# Quantum RISC-V Example Program
# This program demonstrates both classical and quantum operations

# Initialize quantum registers
qinit x1    # Initialize x1 as a quantum register
qinit x2    # Initialize x2 as a quantum register

# Apply quantum gates
qapply x1, x1, 3  # Apply Hadamard gate to x1
qapply x2, x2, 0  # Apply X gate to x2

# Entangle the registers
qentangle x3, x1, x2  # Entangle x1 and x2, store result in x3

# Classical computation
addi x4, x0, 42      # Load immediate value 42 into x4
addi x5, x0, 58      # Load immediate value 58 into x5
add x6, x4, x5       # Add x4 and x5, store in x6

# Measure quantum register
qmeasure x7, x3      # Measure x3 and store result in x7

# Final classical computation
add x8, x6, x7       # Add classical result (x6) with quantum measurement (x7)
